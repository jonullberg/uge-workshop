   Unix and Git For Everyone
*****************************/

/****************************
   
   Goals:
   -  Comfort and agility around the command line
   -  Mastery of basic versioning workflow with git

   Agenda
   -  Find/install cmd line
   -  Get accustomed to finding your way around
   -  Create a journal to record what you learn
   -  Put your journal into version control with basic git workflow
   -  Learn some more advanced shell commands
   -  Learn some more advanced git commands

   By the end of today
   -  Using on your browser, text editor and cmd line, you'll be able to:
   -  move around and manipulate files with confidence
   -  learn about common unix commands
   -  run programs from your cmd line
   -  control access to your filesystem
   -  create a git repository from scratch
   -  add, edit, and remove items from a repository
   -  upload to remote repository (github)

   What is Unix?
   -  Multiuser Multitasking Operating System

   History
   -  Created at AT&T's Bell labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (also made C)
   -  In 1984 Richard Stallman began the creation of GNU Project (Gnu's not Unix)
      with the intention of creating an open source version of Unix
   -  

   Philosophy
   -  Everything is a file
      -  Including pieces of the Kernel and hardware
      -  Linux exposes these interfaces in /proc and /sys
      -  OSX does not directly expose these interfaces to the user, instead use sysctl
   -  "Do one thing and do it well"
   -  "Every output can become the input of another program"

   Two major Unix Components
   -  Kernel
      -  Is the aboslue core of the OS
      -  Determines what runs on the CPU
      -  Interacts directly with the hardware
   -  The shell
      -  How the user interacts with the OS
   -  Representing two different execution environments
      -  Kernel space
      -  User space

   Kernel Space
   -  Represents the "admin" space
   -  Directly affects the hardware, filesystem and how the system itself runs
   -  You need elevated access in order to manipulate anything here
   -  At the same time, users need to be able to access things like hardware and the filesystem
   -  The Kernel provides "system calls"

   User Space
   -  Has to use system calls to access hardware
   -  Manifests as a "shell" run in a terminal

/****************************

   Travelling the user space

   CONCEPT: The Path
   -  Paths are like addresses but backwards
      USA
      Mountlake Terrace, WA
      **Address**
      Jonathan
   -  if it starts with a "/" it is absolute path
   -  My working directory /home/jonathan
   -  cd / -- will send you to ROOT directory

   CONCEPT: The Root
   -  The root is the topmost container of computer filesystem
   -  The root is restricted to administrative users
   -  YOU SHOULD NEVER DELETE ANYTHING FROM THE ROOT

   CONCEPT: Naming Convention
   -  Don't use spaces in naming files, prefer dashes and underscores
   -  Use lowercase letters as much as possible
   

*****************************/

/****************************

   CONCEPT: Piping ( | )
   -  Allows you to redirect your output to another command
      -  Chains commands together
   CONCEPT: Redirection ( > )
   -  allows you to redirect the data into another file
      - Will overwrite whatever former file was
   -  >> allows you to append rather than overwrite

*****************************/

/****************************

   Key Terms:
   cd - change directory (move to a different folder)
   ls - list (list out the files in a directory)
      -l  long form
      -t  sort by time
      -a  show all files
      -r  reverse order of files
      -
   pwd - print working directory
   man - prints out the manual
   -  When working with spaces, you have to escape \ your space, 
      or else unix reads it as a delimiter

   /  will go back to root directory or is absolute path beginning
   ~  is a replacement for your home directory
   .. will go up a directory
   .  will represent cwd

   -  When you start typing, you can use tab and it will autocomplete
      -  If there is one option it will autocomplete it
      -  If there are multiple options starting with those letters it will show you all options
         -  Every successive tab will cycle through multiple options
   less - prints out the output but allows you to scroll through it
   head - prints out first 10 lines of file (-n will set amount of lines)
   tail - saa except prints LAST 10 lines of file

   mv - moves file, takes two parameters, first file you want to move, second is where to       move it to, can also be used to rename a file
